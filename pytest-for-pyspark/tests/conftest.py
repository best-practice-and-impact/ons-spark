    Set up the Spark session by using a fixture decorator.
    
    This will be passed to all the tests by having spark as an
        input. Being able to define the Spark session in this
        way is one advantage of Pytest over unittest.
    
    Has several options for scope:
        "function" will build and close it for each function
        "session" will last for all the tests
        
    Generally, "session" will be chosen as the fixture only needs
        to be set up once and this will make the tests run faster
