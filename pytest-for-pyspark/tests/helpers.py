def assert_pyspark_df_equal(actual_df, expected_df):
    """
    Tests if two DataFrames are equal. Adapted from code originally
        written by Dave Greasley (https://github.com/DaveGreasley).
    
    First tests that the columns are equal, including the column order. If
        not an AssertionError is raised.
    
    Then uses .exceptAll() twice to find rows that are in the expected_df 
        but not in the actual_df, and vice versa. If they are identical
        then the count of both of these should be zero; if not, an 
        assertionError is raised.
        
    This function can be expanded to print out more information about any
        test failure, e.g. diff_ab.union(diff_ba).show() if the count is
        greater than zero. You can also modify it to account for columns
        having a different order by testing set equality and then setting
        expected_df = expected_df.select(actual_df.columns). For this
        example however it is left as simple as possible.
        
    Pytest knows this function is not to be ran as a test as it doesn't
        start or end with the word "test" and is contained in a non-test
        module.

    Args:
        actual_df (spark DataFrame): DF to be tested
        expected_df (spark DataFrame): expected result
