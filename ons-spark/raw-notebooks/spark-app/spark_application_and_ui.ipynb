    "## Spark Application Overview\n",
    "A Spark application has an underlining structure and learning about this structure will help us\n",
    "1. understand the difference between a narrow transformation, wide transformation and an action, \n",
    "2. navigate around the Spark UI\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a diagram of the Spark application hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Application** - a set of jobs managed by a single driver, e.g. on a Cloudera platform that is the CDSW session. An application is created when we connect to Spark with a `SparkSession` in PySpark or `spark_connect()` in sparklyr.\n",
    "- **Job** - a set of stages executed as a result of an *action*, e.g. `.count()`/`sdf_nrow()`. A job might consist of a number of *transformations*, but a job always finishes with an *action*.\n",
    "- **Stage** - a set of tasks that can be executed in parallel. Similar to how *actions* define a job boundary, a stage boundary is introduced by a *wide* transformation, such as `.groupby()`/`group_by()` or `.join()`/`left_join()`. A stage might consist of many *narrow* transformations, but a stage always finishes with a *wide* transformation or action.\n",
    "- **Task** - an individual unit of work assigned to a single core on an executor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram of Spark application showing partitioned DataFrame going through narrow and wide operations](../images/spark_app_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Jobs, Stages and Tasks are numbered starting from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now look more closely at the DataFrame. On the left there is a Spark DataFrame which is split up into four sections, called *partitions*. Spark puts our data into partitions automatically so we don't have to decide how or when to do it. More details on exactly how Spark does this are in the **Partitions Article**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first operation to be applied to this DataFrame is a *narrow* transformation, e.g. summing two columns to create a new column. The second operation is again a narrow transformation. These two operations can be run in parallel, because each child partition has only one parent, indicated by the golden arrows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we hit a stage boundary, which means the third operation is a *wide* transformation, e.g. aggregating the data or joining with another DataFrame. This is a wide operation because each child partition has multiple parent partitions. This is also an example of *shuffling* the data, which means to move data between partitions, more on shuffling in the **Shuffling Article**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally in the diagram above there is another narrow operation on the aggregated DataFrame before we run into an *action*, e.g. writing the data to HDFS or a simple count of the rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we execute the wide and narrow transformations nothing happens to the data at this point in time, Spark just builds up a plan of what to do with the DataFrame. This plan is a called the execution plan and is a set of instructions of how to transform the data from one state to another. More on the execution plan in the **Persisting Article**. An action initiates the execution plan and so this is when the DataFrame is processed. All the previous transformations, along with the action, are put into Spark *jobs* and deployed on the Spark cluster. "

The second stage in this job moves the data from the cluster to the CDSW session. This stage has 200 tasks, because `aggregated_spark` has 200 partitions, more on why this is the case in the **Partitions article**. A screenshot of the *Stage details* for these tasks is below.\n",

Also by comparing the *Duration* (useful processing time) metrics with that of *Scheduler Delay* and *Task Deserialization Time* in the *Summary Metrics* table.
