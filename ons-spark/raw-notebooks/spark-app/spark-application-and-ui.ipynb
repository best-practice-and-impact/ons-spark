    "## Spark Application and UI\n",
    "\n",
    "This article introduces the structure of a Spark application and how the structure relates to the various pages within the application monitoring interface, the Spark UI. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Spark UI is used to monitor the status and resource consumption of your Spark cluster and is the main tool for troubleshooting slow Spark code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the structure of a Spark application helps to understand how Spark works so you can begin to think differently as you code to get the most out of Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spark Application Overview\n",
    "A Spark application has an underlining structure and learning about this structure will help us:\n",
    "1. understand the difference between a narrow transformation, wide transformation and an action \n",
    "2. navigate around the Spark UI\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a diagram of the Spark application hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Application** - a set of jobs managed by a single driver, e.g. on a Cloudera platform that is the CDSW session. An application is created when we connect to Spark with a [`SparkSession`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.SparkSession.html) in PySpark or [`spark_connect()`](https://spark.rstudio.com/packages/sparklyr/latest/reference/spark-connections.html) in sparklyr.\n",
    "- **Job** - a set of stages executed as a result of an *action*, e.g. [`.count()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.count.html)/[`sdf_nrow()`](https://spark.rstudio.com/packages/sparklyr/latest/reference/sdf_dim.html). A job might consist of a number of *transformations*, but a job always finishes with an *action*.\n",
    "- **Stage** - a set of tasks that can be executed in parallel. Similar to how *actions* define a job boundary, a stage boundary is introduced by a *wide* transformation, such as [`.groupBy()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.groupBy.html)/[`group_by()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html) or [`.join()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.join.html)/[`left_join()`](https://spark.rstudio.com/packages/sparklyr/latest/reference/join.tbl_spark.html). A stage might consist of many *narrow* transformations, but a stage always finishes with a *wide* transformation or action.\n",
    "- **Task** - an individual unit of work assigned to a single core on an executor.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/spark_app_diagram.png\n",
    "---\n",

    "alt: Diagram representing Spark application showing partitioned DataFrame going through narrow and wide operations\n",
    "---\n",
    "Spark application\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Jobs, Stages and Tasks are numbered starting from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now look more closely at the DataFrame. On the left there is a Spark DataFrame which is split up into four sections, called *partitions*. Spark puts our data into partitions automatically so we don't have to decide how or when to do it. More details on exactly how Spark does this are in the [Partitions Article](../spark-concepts/partitions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first operation to be applied to this DataFrame is a *narrow* transformation, e.g. adding two columns to create a new column. The second operation is again a narrow transformation. These two operations can be run in parallel, because each child partition has only one parent, indicated by the golden arrows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we hit a stage boundary, which means the third operation is a *wide* transformation, e.g. aggregating the data or joining with another DataFrame. This is a wide operation because each child partition has multiple parent partitions. This is also an example of *shuffling* the data, which means to move data between partitions, more on shuffling in the [Shuffling Article](../spark-concepts/shuffling).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally in the diagram above there is another narrow operation on the aggregated DataFrame before we run into an *action*, e.g. writing the data to HDFS or a simple count of the rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we execute the wide and narrow transformations nothing happens to the data at this point in time, Spark just builds up a plan of what to do with the DataFrame. This plan is a called the execution plan and is a set of instructions of how to transform the data from one state to another. More on the execution plan in the [Persisting Article](../spark-concepts/persistence). An action initiates the execution plan and so this is when the DataFrame is processed. All the previous transformations, along with the action, are put into Spark *jobs* and deployed on the Spark cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Investigate the Spark UI\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create an application and execute some code to create jobs. Then we can drill down from Job to Stage to Task and investigate their performance. In most cases this is where we look first when trying to diagnose a slow Spark application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create an application\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create an application. Once we create a Spark application we can look at the Spark UI. If we stop the Spark session using [`spark.stop()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.SparkSession.stop.html)/[`spark_disconnect()`](https://spark.rstudio.com/packages/sparklyr/latest/reference/spark-connections.html) or disconnect from the notebook, the Spark UI for our application can no longer be accessed.\n",

    "Let's look at the *Completed Jobs* table. The description gives us a clue as to the action that initiated that job. The first job, *Job Id* 0, was to interact with HDFS, so it has the description `parquet at NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:0`. Remember that executing transformations creates an execution plan, so Spark needs to know the DataFrame's schema, i.e. column names and types, to validate our PySpark/sparklyr code. Reading from disk will always create a job, usually consisting of just one stage as shown in the *Stages* column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second job was initiated by [`.show()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.show.html)/[`collect()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/compute.html), again it consists of one stage, which itself had one task as shown in the *Tasks* column. As mentioned in the previous section, Spark only needed to process one partition to produce the output so we therefore have one task in this job. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third job was the `.count()`/`sdf_nrow()`. The job contains two stages, which themselves consist of 3 tasks. Let's get more information on these stages and tasks. Within the *Completed Jobs* table click on the link in the *Description* column for the latest job that says `count at NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:0`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are on the *Job Details* page which show information about the job's stages. The first stage had two tasks, one task to count the rows in each partition. The second stage had one task, which was to send the result to the driver for us to see. On this page you will see another type of diagram called a Directed Acyclic Graph or DAG, by opening the *DAG Vizualisation* collapsible section.\n",

    "The `.toPandas()`/`collect()` job has two stages because the `.groupBy()`[`.agg()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.agg.html)/`group_by() %>% `[`summarise()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html) command is a wide transformation. In the first stage the data is read in, a new column added and then the dataset is aggregated. This stage has 2 tasks because the `rescue` DataFrame has 2 partitions. The second stage in this job moves the data from the cluster to the CDSW session. This stage has 200 tasks, because `aggregated_spark` has 200 partitions, more on why this is the case in the [Partitions](../spark-concepts/partitions). A screenshot of the *Stage details* for these tasks is below.\n",

Also by comparing the *Duration* (useful processing time) metrics with that of *Scheduler Delay* and *Task Deserialization Time* in the *Summary Metrics* table. Would we get better performance if the `aggregated_spark` DataFrame had fewer partitions?
