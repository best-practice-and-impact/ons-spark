    "\n",
    "According to the US Census Bureau, “Synthetic data are microdata records created to improve data utility while preventing disclosure of confidential respondent information. Synthetic data is created by statistically modelling original data and then using those models to generate new data values that reproduce the original data’s statistical properties. Users are unable to identify the information of the entities that provided the original data.”​\n",

    "There are many situations in ONS where the generation of synthetic data could be used to improve outputs. These are listed in [Synthetic data at ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologicalpublications/generalmethodology/onsworkingpaperseries/onsmethodologyworkingpaperseriesnumber16syntheticdatapilot) and they include:\n",
