    "## Sampling: an overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling is something that you may want to do during development or initial analysis of data, as with a smaller amount of data your code will run faster and requires less memory to process. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways that a dataframe can be sampled, the two main types covered in this page are:\n",
    "1) **simple random sampling**: [`.sample()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.sample.html) in Pyspark and [`sdf_sample()`](https://spark.rstudio.com/packages/sparklyr/latest/reference/sdf_sample.html) in SparklyR and\n",
    "2) **stratified sampling**: [`.sampleBy()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.sampleBy.html) in Pyspark. There is currently no way to do stratified sampling in SparklyR when using version 2.4.0 (spark vesion > 3.0.0 is required).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although, these two methods are the focus of this page there are numerous methods that can be used for sampling that will not be covered here, such as systematic sampling and cluster sampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both `.sample()` and `.sampleBy()` in Pyspark use the same base functions for sampling with and without replacement. For sampling without replacement PySpark implements a uniform sampling method using random number generation. A row will be added to the sample if the randomly generated number is smaller than the fraction input and each row has an equal probability of being sampled. Whereas for sampling with replacement numbers are generated from a Poisson sample. A link to the alogirithm breakdown can be found [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/rddsampler.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that sampling in Spark returns an approximate fraction of the data, rather than an exact one. The reason for this is explained in the [sample](#sampling-sample-and-sdf_sample) section.\n",

    "### Sampling: `.sample()` and `sdf_sample()`\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `.sample()` in Pyspark and `sdf_sample()` in SparklyR you take a sampled subset of the original dataframe by setting a `seed`, a `fraction` and whether replacement is required. For the latter argument, in PySpark you use `withReplacement =`, if this is not set then the default answer is `False`, on the other hand in SparklyR you use `replacement =` and if not set the default answer = `True`. For both functions, `seed` is an optional argument which defaults to a random seed. The `fraction` however is compulsory and must be a value betwen 0.0 and 1.0; so, if we want to obtain a 20% sample we would use `fraction = 0.2`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these two functions it is advised to specify the arguments explicitly. One reason being that in Pyspark `fraction` must come after `withReplacement` whereas when you use `sdf_sample()` in SparklyR `fraction` must be listed first. If you use both languages it is easy to make this mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the [PySpark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.2/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.sample.html), we see that a uniform sampling method is used for `.sample()`. Here each each row is equally likely to be sampled. \n",
    "We should check that this is indeed occuring for an evenly distrubuted dataframe across a number of partitions (`rescue`) and a skewed dataset (`skew_df`). As both `.sample` and `sdf_sample()` implement uniform sampling, an *approximate* sample is returned, so you will get either slightly more or less than the specified fraction you originally input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sampling without replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform checks on the `.sample()` function to determine how this will impact our skewed distribution. We will also check how the partitions impact the end distribution.\n",

The number of rows returned in the sample therefore follows the binomial distribution.\n",
