    "## Tip of the Week: Staging Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Staging tables are an alternative way of checkpointing data in Spark, in which the data is written out as a named Hive table in a database, rather than to the checkpointing location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A quick recap of persisting\n",
    "\n",
    "Persisting in Spark is where we store the data at an intermediate point of the code in memory or on disk. This is generally done with `.cache()` (to store the data in memory) or `.checkpoint()` (to write it to disk). If you are not familiar with the concept of persisting, please read the [Persisting in Spark notebook](http://np2rvlapxx507/DAP_CATS/Training/more-spark/blob/master/more_spark/notebooks/material/persist.ipynb) which explains these concepts in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, if your code is short and non-complex then it is unlikely you will need any form of persisting in your code, but if you have long and complex code sensible persisting can help make it more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Staging tables: the concept\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write a staging table to HDFS with `df.write.mode(\"overwrite\").saveAsTable(table_name, format=\"parquet\")` or `df.write.insertInto(table_name, overwrite=True)`(of course, if using `.insertInto()` you will need to create the table first). You can then read the table back in with `spark.read.table()`. Like with checkpointing, this will break the lineage of the DataFrame, and therefore they can be useful in large, complex pipelines, or those that involve processes in a loop. As Spark is more efficient at reading in tables than CSV files, another use case is staging CSV files as tables at the start of your code before doing any complex calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Staging has some advantages over checkpointing:\n",
    "- The same table can be overwritten, meaning there is no need to clean up old checkpointed files\n",
    "- It is stored in a location that is easier to access, rather than the checkpointing folder, which can help with debugging and testing changes to the code\n",
    "- They can be re-used elsewhere\n",
    "- If `.insertInto()` is used, you can take advantage of the table schema, as an exception will be raised if the DataFrame and table schemas do not match\n",
    "- It is more efficient for Spark to read Hive tables than CSV files as the underlying format is Parquet, so if your data are delivered as CSV files you may want to stage them as Hive tables first. For more information see the [Storing as a Parquet tip](http://np2rvlapxx507/DAP_CATS/troubleshooting/tip-of-the-week/blob/master/tip_18_parquet.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some disadvantages:\n",
    "- Takes longer to write the code\n",
    "- More difficult to maintain, especially if `.insertInto()` is used, as you will have to alter the table if the DataFrame structure changes\n",
    "- Ensure that you are not using them unnecessarily (the same is true with any method of persisting data)\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples here use PySpark, but the same principles apply to R users who are using sparklyr in DAP."
