    "In many ways, Hive tables have a lot of the same benefits that a parquet file has, such as the storing of schemas and supporting predicate pushdowns. In fact, a Hive table may consist of parquet files - a parquet file is often the default underlying file structure Spark uses when saving out a Hive table. A Hive table can consist of any of the underlying data formats we've discussed in this chapter. The key difference with a Hive table compared to the other data formats is that a Hive table tends to store more detailed metadata.\n"

    "## So, which file format should I use?\n",
    "There are a number of factors to consider when deciding which file format to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Do I need my data to be human-readable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the file formats discussed in this chapter, only CSV files are human-readable. This means that if you need to look at the data yourself, i.e. for quality assurance purposes, you would need to ensure that your data is in a CSV file. However, CSV files are generally less efficient to read in than other file formats such as parquet or ORC files, particularly if you only require a subset of the available columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also important to note that Spark is a big data solution, so if you're only working with only a small amount of data that needs to be manually examined by a human, it may be worth reconsidering whether Spark is needed at all - it could be a good idea to read [when to use Spark](../spark-overview/when-to-use-spark.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Row-based vs columnar-based formats\n",
    "Generally, both row-based and columnar-based formats are fine to use with Spark. The benefits of choosing one or the other are highly dependent on downstream processing and would likely result in relatively small improvements in processing speed. For a more in-depth discussion on which types of downstream processing would be more suited to a row-based or a columnar-based file format, [this article](https://www.snowflake.com/trending/avro-vs-parquet) may be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Do you work primarily with databases/SQL?\n",
    "If you're primarily working with databases/tables within databases and SQL, it may be a good idea to use a Hive table. You can use any format as the underlying data format within a Hive table - so it may be worthwhile reviewing the data formats presented in this chapter to decide which format would be most appropriate for your use case."
