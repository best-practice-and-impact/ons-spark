    "# Managing partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrames in Spark are *distributed*, so although we treat them as one object they might be split up into multiple partitions over many machines on the cluster. The benefit of having multiple partitions is that some operations can be performed on the partitions in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "More partitions means greater *parallelisation*. However, there is a cost associated with multiple partitions, for example scheduling delay and data serialisation. In the **Spark Application and UI** article we saw that putting a small DataFrame into one or two partitions can lead to more efficient processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will explore these partitions and how the partitioning of a DataFrame is affected by importing, processing and writing data in Spark. The goal is not to find the optimum number of partitions for a given DataFrame, the goal is to have greater awareness of partitioning so we can avoid the extreme cases of over-partitioning, under-partitioning and highly skewed partitioning.\n",

    "## Investigating partitions\n",

    "We will start by investigating the partitions of some DataFrames. We will look at the partitions of a newly created DataFrame, an imported DataFrame and a processed DataFrame. But first, we'll need to do some imports and create a local application in the usual way."

    "Quite a few empty partitions- this is a clear case of overpartitioning. In the **Spark Applications and UI article** it was shown that overpartitioning leads to slower processing as a larger proportion of time is spent on scheduling tasks and (de)serialising data instead of processing the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, there is a property we can modify in the Spark session configuration to change this behaviour. The property to override is `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`. *Shuffle partitions* means when a shuffle occurs, for example a *wide* operation. So this property says \"give the resulting DataFrame this many partitions\". See the **article on Shuffling** for more information on shuffles. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html#runtime-sql-configuration) shows that the default value for `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` is 200. This default is obviously too high for our case of grouping a small dataset with a small number of groups i.e. `PostcodeDistrict`. This is one of the more useful properties to consider changing depending on the size of the data you want to process with Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "We noted above that sparklyr would give different results. Using a local sparklyr session there is another property that is used for partitioning after a wide operation, `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions.local`, which is set to 16 by default.\n",

    "## How to change partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we look at how to modify DataFrame partitioning, let's revisit the motivation for wanting to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can change the number of partitions of a DataFrame to achieve less or more parallelisation. More parallel processing is great for large DataFrames, but there are some scheduling and data serialisation overheads involved in processing multiple partitions. So for small DataFrames it's best to have just a small number of partition because the overheads involved in organising and writing multiple partitions will result in slower processing. However, we don't always get to choose the partitioning, e.g. to do a join Spark must first put rows with the same join keys on the same partition. More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We can also partition by a specified column(s) in the DataFrame. This can be useful when writing to a Hive table or file becuase we can then read in single partitions. For example, say we had a DataFrame containing records from the past 20 years. We could partition this DataFrame by year when writing it to disk, then in future we could read in one year at a time or multiple years to speed up future tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two ways of changing the number of partitions of a DataFrame. One is `.repartition()`/`sdf_repartition()` and the other is `coalesce()`/`sdf_coalesce()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to use these functions."

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have all the information on how Spark performed these processes we can compare the three cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three operations involve an intermediate shuffle where the join key/grouped variable/windows are moved to the same partitions. This is called `hashpartitioning()` in the execution plan. As we mentioned previously, these are all wide transformations so the number of partitions of the output DataFrames are the same, 200. Listed below are the differences in processing and output DataFrames for the three operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Join**\n",
    "\n",
    "There was much more work to be done on the larger partition than the smaller ones. The Spark UI shows there were more records to process on the large partition therefore the task takes much longer. Note the number of records processed in each task matches the number of rows in each join key. The output DataFrame is partitioned by the join key. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Group by**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the group by the skewed variable isn't too much of an issue because the aggregation is quite simple and is optimised, therefore it is easy to process each partition whether there is skew or not. Again, the output DataFrame is partitioned by the grouped variable, this time there is one row on each partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Window**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the join, there is more work to do on the larger partitions. However, unlike the join, the rows of the output DataFrame have the same partition IDs as the input DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does this mean in practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "Highly skewed data is a common issue that causes slow processing with Spark. Above we have seen that skewed data causes skewed partitions when Spark processes wide transformations and can result in bottlenecks, where some tasks take much longer than others therefore not utilising the full potential of parallel processing. An even worse situation is where the skew causes spill, where the large partition cannot fit into its allocated memory on an executor and overflows temporarily onto disk. We cannot recreate the issue of spill in a local session but they are easy to spot in the Stage details page in the Spark UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where knowing your data can be useful. To help with the explanation we will refer to the join keys/groups/windows as groups. If a join/group by/window function is causing you issues, try to work out how many groups there are and the sizes of these groups. If there are lots on smaller groups it might help to increase `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` and aim for greater parallel power with lots of smaller executors. If there are fewer groups you might want to scale more vertically so decrease `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` and aim for a smaller number of bulkier executors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are doing a join on a highly skewed DataFrame you might want to try a **salted join**. If you are dealing with skew in a window function you can apply a group by and join to achieve the same result. However, these are alternative solutions when dealing with highly skewed data and in most cases a regular join or window function are more efficient and makes the code more readable. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Partitions when writing data\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, we can also partition by a certain column when writing to disk. The reason why this is useful is we can choose which partitions we want to read in later. This is really useful for larger data sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we demonstrate this by writing the `rescue` DataFrame as parquet files, we need to remove the `£` signs from the column names as these are not supported by the parquet format. In sparklyr they are replaced automatically when reading in the csv file, so no need for this step."
