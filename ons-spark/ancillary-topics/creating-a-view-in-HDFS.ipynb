    "A view in SQL is a way of storing a query by creating a virtual table. This can be useful for many reasons, one being that you can more easily get your desired output as it is simpler to access a view than typing a query from scratch repeatedly. For more information on SQL views please refer to [Views in SQL](https://learnsql.com/blog/sql-view/).\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, SQL views can be used to avoid the re-running or pre-processing everytime you would like to use the same data (that has been created using a query) and avoids saving an entirely new table. An SQL view is simply a stoerd query that is applied to an underlying Hive table; **only** the metadata of the view will be stored and this happens after the query has been ran. Another advanateg of a is that it refreshes in real-time, which means if the underlying table updates then your view will, the reason being is that each time your view is called the statement used to create the view from the underlying table is re-ran. \n",

    "**Please note that a view is a virtual table**.\n",

    "## Creating a View\n",
    "Below we have an example of using SQL views. We will be working with an existing Hive table called `rescue_clean`. Upon this table we will create a view that involves some very simple processing of the data. To create a view we first need to login to HUE and navigate to where the Hive databases are stored (under the SQL tab on the left-hand-side); the database we are wanting is called `train_tmp` as this is where `rescue_clean` is stored. Please ensure that your editor type is set to Hive (click on the arrow beside the blue Query button and select \"Editor -> Hive\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are in the right location, we can start to create a SQL view. To do this we use the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` command in SQL: "
