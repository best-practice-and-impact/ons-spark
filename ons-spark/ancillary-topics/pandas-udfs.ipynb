    "# Pandas UDFs TESTING"

    "When coding with Spark, you will generally want to try and use native Spark functions wherever possible (i.e. functions in `pyspark.sql.functions` for PySpark). However, there are instances where there may not be a Spark function available to do what you need. In cases such as this, the second best option is to use a Pandas UDF. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are Pandas UDFs better than Python UDFs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary Python UDFs are not particularly efficient in Spark as they do not make full use of the Spark cluster and can only be processed in the Python runtime. As the code for Python UDFs cannot be executed in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the platform which runs Spark, each row of the dataframe is serialised and deserialised between the Python runtime and the JVM. As can be imagined, this causes massive (de)serialisation overheads, high data copy in memory and is very slow!\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas UDFs (also known as vectorised UDFs) can work on the Spark executors to process data in a distributed manner and allow for vectorised operations. This means that Pandas UDFs can work on the whole data partition at once instead of just one row at a time like Python UDFs. This vectorisation is achieved by using Apache Arrow to transfer data across the cluster between the JVM and the Python executors with very low data copy in memory and (de)serialisation overheads. Essentially, Apache Arrow acts as a middleman to store a single copy of the data which can be accessed by both Python and Java processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Pandas UDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark 2.4 is compatible with 3 types of Pandas UDFs:\n",
    "- Scalar\n",
    "- Grouped Map\n",
    "- Grouped Aggregate\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark 3.x is compatible with the additional types:\n",
    "- Scalar Iterator\n",
    "- Map\n",
    "- Cogroup Mapped\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo will cover the three types supported in Spark 2.4. Additional information on the other types for Spark 3.x can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/pyspark-or-pandas-why-not-both-95523946ec7c).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaring Pandas UDFs in Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a Pandas UDF in a number of ways.\n",
    "- Using the `@pandas_udf(<type>, F.PandasUDFType.<type>)` decorator.\n",
    "- Assigning the UDF using `<udf_name>_udf = F.pandas_udf(<udf_name>, returnType = <type>)`\n",
    "- Using Python Type hints. Python hints can be used to make Pandas UDFs more descriptive. For more info see [here](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2020/05/20/new-pandas-udfs-and-python-type-hints-in-the-upcoming-release-of-apache-spark-3-0.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo will use the `pandas_udf` decorator and Python hints to annotate the functions with the input and output data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spark Setup for Pandas UDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "For Spark 3, to use Pandas UDFs you will have to install Pandas and PyArrow using:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install pandas\n",
    "pip install pyarrow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For Spark 2.4 you will need to install the older versions of Pandas and PyArrow using. We found the following versions to be the highest which will work with Pandas UDFs, although expect a deprecation warning:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install pandas==1.1.5\n",
    "pip install pyarrow==0.14.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "The [offical PySpark Usage Guide for Pandas with Apache Arrow](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.7/sql-pyspark-pandas-with-arrow.html#compatibiliy-setting-for-pyarrow--0150-and-spark-23x-24x) advises that compatibility issues may occur with Pandas >0.19.2 and PyArrow >0.8.0, so if you are finding issues, it may be best to switch to these lower versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also add configs to enable PyArrow optimisation and fallback if it is not installed. Even if you are not using Pandas UDFs the below configs can make the conversion between Pandas and Spark more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".config('spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled', 'true')\n",
    ".config('spark.sql.execution.arrow.fallback.enabled', 'true')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For Spark 2.4 you will need to add the below additional configs to your Spark session for compatibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".config('spark.excutorEnv.ARROW_PRE_0_15_IPC_FORMAT', 1)\n",
    ".config('spark.workerEnv.ARROW_PRE_0_15_IPC_FORMAT', 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our demo we are using a local Spark session and will be working with the animal rescue dataset used throughout in this book. We have used examples of Pandas UDFs applied to the rescue dataset only for the purpose of demonstration as there are Spark functions which in a real-life scenario would be used instead. For other simple examples of Pandas UDFs please see [Databricks Introduction to Pandas UDFs](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2017/10/30/introducing-vectorized-udfs-for-pyspark.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we need to import packages and set up a Spark session for PyArrow optimisation and compatibility with Spark 2.4. Then read the data, select and rename the relevant columns and remove nulls:"
