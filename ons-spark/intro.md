# Introduction

```{warning}
This book is under construction.

This Government Analysis Function guidance is produced by the Data Access Platform capability team in the Methods and Quality directorate of the [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/).

This book has been written to fill the gap between Spark text books, official documentation and online examples as the go-to guide for analysts, data scientists and data engineers using PySpark and sparklyr.

The material is a living document, so will be updated over time. We are keen to hear your thoughts and feedback on the book, you can get in touch via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/ons-spark/issues). This book is also open to contributions from anyone across UK Government and beyond.

ONS staff should also look at our GitLab pages for organisation and platform-specific information.

## How to use the book

The materials in this book assume the reader is familiar with Python or R and is looking to process big data using PySpark or sparklyr. There are Python and R code cells throughout the book to help explain the topics.

The **Spark Overview** section introduces some basic concepts like distributed computing, when to use Spark, creating Spark sessions and simple interaction with data storage. There is then a section for **Introduction to PySpark** and **Introduction to sparklyr**. That covers the basics.

The next part if your Spark journey is to learn more functions so you can perform more interesting analysis. These are covered in the **Spark Functions** section. As you build more experience you will begin to think more like a Spark developer, choosing certain strategies that suits how Spark processes data.

The most advanced section of the book is **Understanding and Optimising Spark**. It begins with  a short summary page before diving into more complex optimisation topics.

The latter two sections, **Testing and Debugging** and **Ancillary Topics**, are included for completeness.
