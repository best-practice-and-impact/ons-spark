    "\n",
    "We have demonstrated above that `.sample()` returns an approximate fraction, not an exact one. This is because every row is independently assigned a probability equal to `fraction` of being included in the sample, e.g. with `fraction=0.2` every row has a $20\\%$ probability of being in the sample. The number of rows returned in the sample therefore follows the binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of the sample being calculated in this way is that it is processed as a *narrow transformation*, which is more efficient than a *wide transformation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To return an exact sample, one method is to calculate how many rows are required in the sample, create a new column of random numbers and sort by it, and use `.limit()`. This requires an action and a wide transformation, and so will take longer to process than using `.sample()`."
