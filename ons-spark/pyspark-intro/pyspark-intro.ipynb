    "## Introduction to PySpark\n",
    "\n",
    "This article aims to give hands on experience in working with the DataFrame API in PySpark. You can download this article as a notebook and run the code yourself by clicking on the download button above and selecting `.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not aim to cover all the PySpark DataFrame functionality or go into detail of how Spark works, but instead focus on practicality by performing some common operations on an example dataset. There are a handful of exercises that you can complete while reading this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites for this article are some basic knowledge of Python and pandas. If you are completely new to Python then it is recommended to complete an introductory course first; your organisation may have specific Python training. Other resources include the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) and [10 Minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### PySpark: a quick introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this article focusses on practical usage to enable you to quickly use PySpark, you do need to understand some basic theory of Spark and distributed computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark is a powerful tool used to process huge data in an efficient way. We can access Spark in Python with the PySpark package. Spark has DataFrames, consisting of rows and columns, similar to pandas. Many of the operations are also similar, if not identically named: e.g. you can select and add columns, filter rows, group and aggregate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between PySpark and pandas is where the DataFrame is processed:\n",
    "- pandas DataFrames are processed on the *driver*; this could be on a local machine using a desktop IDE such as Spyder or PyCharm, or on a server, e.g. in a dedicated Docker container (such as a CDSW session). The amount of data you can process is limited to the driver memory, so pandas is suitable for smaller data.\n",
    "- PySpark DataFrames are processed on the *Spark cluster*. This is a big pool of linked machines, called *nodes*. PySpark DataFrames are distributed into *partitions*, and are processed in parallel on the nodes in the Spark cluster. You can have much greater memory capacity with Spark and so is suitable for big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame is also processed differently:\n",
    "- In pandas, the DataFrame changes in memory at each point, e.g. you could create a DataFrame by reading from a CSV file, select some columns, filter the rows, add a column and then write the data out. With each operation, the DataFrame is physically changing in memory. This can be useful for debugging as it is easy to see intermediate outputs.\n",
    "- In PySpark, DataFrames are *lazily evaluated*. We give Spark a set of instructions, called *transformations*, which are only evaluated when necessary, for instance to get a row count or write out data to a file, referred to as an *action*. In the example above, the plan is triggered once the data are set to write out to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detail on how Spark works, you can refer to the articles in the Understanding and Optimising Spark chapter of this book. [Databricks: Learning Spark](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/LearningSpark2.0.pdf) is another useful resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `pyspark` Package\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all coding scripts or notebooks the first thing we do is to import the relevant packages. When coding in PySpark there are two particular imports we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly we will import the [`SparkSession`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.SparkSession.html) class, which we will use to create a `SparkSession` object for processing data using Spark. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second is the [`pyspark.sql.functions`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql.html#functions) module, which contain functions that can be applied to Spark DataFrames, or columns within the DataFrames. The standard method is to import the `functions` module with the alias `F`, which means whenever we want to call a function from this module we write `F.function_name()`."

There are a lot of functions in this module and you will be very unlikely to use them all.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Spark session: `SparkSession.builder`\n",
    "\n",
    "With our `SparkSession` class imported we now want to create a connection to the Spark cluster. We use [`SparkSession.builder`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.SparkSession.html#pyspark.sql.SparkSession.builder) and assign this to `spark`. `SparkSession.builder` has many options; see the guidance on Spark sessions and also Sample Spark Sessions to get an idea of what sized session to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this article, we are using a tiny dataset by Spark standards, and so are using a *local* session. This also means that you can run this code without having access to a Spark cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that only one Spark session can be running at once. If a session already exists then a new one will not created, instead the connection to the existing session will be used, hence the [`.getOrCreate()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate.html) method."

    "For this article we will look at some open data on animal rescue incidents from the London Fire Brigade. The data are stored as a CSV, although the parquet file format is the most common when using Spark. The reason for using CSV in this article is because it is a familiar file format and allows you to adapt this code easily for your own sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often your data will be large and stored using Hadoop, on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). This example uses a local file, enabling us to get started quickly; see the article on HDFS for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To read in from a CSV file, use [`spark.read.csv()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrameReader.csv.html). The file path is stored in the config file as `rescue_path_csv`. Using `header=True` means that the DataFrame will use the column headers from the CSV as the column names.

If converting to a pandas DF just to view the data, use [`.limit()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.limit.html) to just bring back a small number of rows.\n",
