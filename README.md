# Spark at the ONS

Spark learning materials compiled by members of the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The materials in the book are intended as general resources on using Spark and should also be applicable to users outside of ONS. Please note that for internal ONS users, the guidance in this book is not intended to be specific to any particular platform where Spark can be run. As a result, you may find it useful to consult internal sources of guidance (such as DAPCATS training materials) if you need support with your platform specific setup.  
<!--Should there be more detail here about what kinds of content we have in the book? -->

### Hosting the book

Please see the [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/publish/web.html) to discover options for deploying a book online using services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Netlify.

For GitHub and GitLab deployment specifically, the [cookiecutter-jupyter-book](https://github.com/executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book) includes templates for, and information about, optional continuous integration (CI) workflow files to help easily and automatically deploy books online with GitHub or GitLab. For example, if you chose `github` for the `include_ci` cookiecutter option, your book template was created with a GitHub actions workflow file that, once pushed to GitHub, automatically renders and pushes your book to the `gh-pages` branch of your repo and hosts it on GitHub Pages when a push or pull request is made to the main branch.
