    "\n",
    "Spark uses lazy evaluation. As we build up many transformations Spark creates an execution plan for the DataFrame and the plan is executed when an action is called. This execution plan represents the DataFrame's lineage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the DataFrame's lineage can grow long and complex, which will slow down the processing and maybe even return an error. However, we can get around this by breaking the lineage.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is more than one way of breaking the lineage of a DataFrame, which is discussed in more detail in the [Persisting](../spark-concepts/persistence) section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we cover a simple method of persisting to disk called checkpointing, which is essentially an out of the box shortcut to a write/read operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the benefit of checkpointing we'll time how long it takes to create a DataFrame using an iterative calculation. We will run the process without persisting, then again using a checkpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create a new Spark session each time just in case there's an advantage when processing the DataFrame a second time in the same session. We will also use the Python module [`time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) to measure the time taken to create the DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to create a new DataFrame with an `id` column and a column called `col_0` that will consist of random numbers. We'll then create a loop to add new columns where the values depend on a previous column. The contents of the columns isn't important here. What is important is that Spark is creating an execution plan that it getting longer with each iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we try to avoid using loops with Spark and this example shows why. A better solution to this problem using Spark would be to add new rows with each iteration as opposed to columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will set a `seed_num` when creating the random numbers to make the results repeatable. The DataFrame will have `num_rows` amount of rows, which we will set to a thousand and the loop will iterate 11 times to create `col_1` to `col_11`."

    "\n",
    "### Staging tables: the concept\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write a staging table to HDFS with `df.write.mode(\"overwrite\").saveAsTable(table_name, format=\"parquet\")` or `df.write.insertInto(table_name, overwrite=True)`(of course, if using `.insertInto()` you will need to create the table first). You can then read the table back in with `spark.read.table()`. Like with checkpointing, this will break the lineage of the DataFrame, and therefore they can be useful in large, complex pipelines, or those that involve processes in a loop. As Spark is more efficient at reading in tables than CSV files, another use case is staging CSV files as tables at the start of your code before doing any complex calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Staging has some advantages over checkpointing:\n",
    "- The same table can be overwritten, meaning there is no need to clean up old checkpointed files\n",
    "- It is stored in a location that is easier to access, rather than the checkpointing folder, which can help with debugging and testing changes to the code\n",
    "- They can be re-used elsewhere\n",
    "- If `.insertInto()` is used, you can take advantage of the table schema, as an exception will be raised if the DataFrame and table schemas do not match\n",
    "- It is more efficient for Spark to read Hive tables than CSV files as the underlying format is Parquet, so if your data are delivered as CSV files you may want to stage them as Hive tables first. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some disadvantages:\n",
    "- Takes longer to write the code\n",
    "- More difficult to maintain, especially if `.insertInto()` is used, as you will have to alter the table if the DataFrame structure changes\n",
    "- Ensure that you are not using them unnecessarily (the same is true with any method of persisting data)\n",
