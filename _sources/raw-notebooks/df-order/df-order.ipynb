    "## Spark DataFrames Are Not Ordered\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark DataFrames do not have the order preserved in the same way as pandas or base R DataFrames. Subsetting a pandas or R DataFrame, e.g. with `head()`, will always return identical rows, whereas the rows returned may be different when subsetting PySpark or sparklyr DFs, e.g with [`.show()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.show.html) or `head()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is that Spark DataFrames are distributed across partitions. Some operations, such as joining, grouping or sorting, cause data to be moved between [partitions](../spark-concepts/partitions), known as a [*shuffle*](../spark-concepts/shuffling). Running the exact same Spark code can result in different data being on different partitions, as well as a different order within each partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Spark DFs are not ordered\n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of an order in a Spark DataFrame is due to two related concepts: partitioning and lazy evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Spark DataFrame is distributed across partitions on the Spark cluster, rather than being one complete object stored in the driver memory. Executing an identical Spark plan can result in the same rows going to different partitions. Within these partitions, the rows can also be in a different order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lazy evaluation will cause the DataFrame to be re-evaluated each time an action is called. Spark will only do the minimum required to return the result of the action specified, e.g. subsetting and previewing the data with `.show()`/`head() %>% ` [`collect()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/compute.html) may not require evaluation of the whole DataFrame (this can be demonstrated when using [caching](../spark-concepts/cache), as the cache may only be partially filled with these operations). As such, if no order is specified then the data may be returned in a different order, despite the Spark plan being identical. If the data is being subset in a non-specific way, e.g. with `.show()`/`head() %>% collect()`, then different rows may be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical term for this is *non-determinism*, which is where the same algorithm can return different results for the same inputs. This can cause problems when regression testing (ensuring that results are identical after a code change) and unit testing your Spark code with [Pytest](../testing-debugging/unit-testing-pyspark) or [testthat](../testing-debugging/unit-testing-sparklyr).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main lesson from this is that if you want to rely on the order of a Spark DataFrame, you need to [explicitly specify the order](../spark-functions/sorting-data); this may involve using a column as a tie-breaker (e.g. a key column such as an ID, which is unique).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does the order really matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at examples, it is worth remembering that often the order of the data does not matter. Ordering data in Spark is an expensive operation as it requires a [shuffle of the data](../spark-concepts/shuffling), so try to avoid sorting if you can. You may want to aim for only ordering the data when [writing out final results](../spark-functions/writing-data) (e.g. to a CSV if you need the result to be human readable).\n",
    "\n",
    "### An example: different order within same partition\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create a new Spark session and a small DataFrame; this example uses the winners of the Six Nations rugby union tournament:"
