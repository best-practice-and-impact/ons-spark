    "## Optimising Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Joining DataFrames is a common and often essential operation in Spark. However, joins are one of the more expensive operations in terms of processing time. This is because by default both source DataFrames are first sorted, which is a *wide transformation*, causing a *shuffle* (or *exchange*). As such, it is worth paying extra attention to where joins occur in the code and trying to figure out which method to use to make them more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article describes the different join algorithms in Spark, explains how they work, when to use them, and shows examples of each. It also covers replacing joins entirely with narrow transformations, and gives a brief overview of [*salted joins*](../spark-concepts/salted-joins), that can be used when the data are skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before reading this article ensure that you understand how to join two DataFrames in Spark. Knowledge of [shuffles](../spark-concepts/shuffling) and the difference between wide and narrow transformations will also help understanding of why some methods are faster than others, although not mandatory. Useful resources on this include the [DataBricks Transformations definition](https://databricks.com/glossary/what-are-transformations), and the [Spark Application and UI](../spark-concepts/spark-application-and-ui), [Shuffling](../spark-concepts/shuffling) and [Partitions](../spark-concepts/partitions) articles in this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that in this notebook when we talk about different joins and the way they are processed we are not talking about left, right, inner or outer joins, but how it is processed on the cluster. The result of the join will always be the same, regardless of which of the algorithms described in this article is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Join Algorithms in Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to know how joins work when writing Spark code, but you can make them more efficient by understanding that there are different ways for them to be processed and coding appropriately. These are:\n",
    "- Shuffle Hash Join\n",
    "- Sort Merge Join\n",
    "- Broadcast Join\n",
    "- Other Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at each in more detail, get a better idea of how they are processed by looking at the Spark UI. We will then compare them and give the advantages and disadvantages of using each.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shuffle Hash Join\n",
    "\n",
    "In the development of Spark, the shuffle hash join was the original join implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This consists of two stages: *shuffle* and *hash*. First a *shuffle*, where data with the same keys from both DataFrames are moved to the same executors. Once all the data are on the relevant executors, they are joined using the hash join algorithm. This involves building a hash table in memory and may fail for some larger joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shuffle hash joins will not be explored further as they have been superseded by sort merge join, which is similar apart from the processing stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sort Merge Join\n",
    "\n",
    "This is now the default method of joining two DataFrames in Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of two key stages, as suggested by the name: *sort* and *merge*.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the data in each DataFrame will be sorted. A sort operation requires a shuffle on each DataFrame. This will also ensure that all the same key values are on the same partition. This also means that the join can be done in parallel on each partition, although it can potentially be a problem if your data are skewed (in which case a *salted join* may be useful).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that both DataFrames are ordered, it is easy to iterate over each row in the DataFrames and see if they have a matching key; if they do, they can be returned as part of the resulting DataFrame. In most circumstances this will be more efficient than the shuffle hash join.\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram should help explain this visually:\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "Sort Merge join\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both sort merge joins and shuffle hash joins use a shuffle; the difference is in the processing stage, where the former uses a searching algorithm and the latter uses a hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sort Merge Join Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see an example of a sort merge join and then look at the plan and the Spark UI. The example uses the Animal Rescue (as parquet) and Population (as parquet) datasets, left joining on the `postcode_district`. Note that we are disabling automatic broadcast joins by setting `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` to `-1`; broadcast joins are covered in the next section. First, start a Spark session, read the data and select and rename the relevant columns:"

    "\n",
    "The sort merge join involves two **Exchanges** (also called *shuffles*), one for the sorting of each source DataFrame (see the Shuffles article for a full discussion of this topic). Spark is most powerful when it can process data in parallel (*narrow transformations*), and sorting is instead a *wide transformation*, causing a *shuffle*, meaning that a sort merge join can take significant time to process, depending on the size and composition of your data. There is a full discussion in the when to use each join method section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sort merge join is the *default* join although not always chosen automatically; the next section on *broadcast joins* explains this further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broadcast Join\n",
    "\n",
    "The other common method is the broadcast join. This can be used when you are joining a small DataFrame to a large one. The smaller DataFrame is copied to every node on the cluster and then a traditional hash join is performed. This avoids the need for the sorting step that exists in the sort merge join, and therefore the expensive shuffles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcast joins are suitable when you are joining a small DataFrame to a larger one. As one DataFrame is pushed to several places, this may actually be too slow or impossible if you are joining two large DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below shows how a broadcast join works visually:\n",

    "---\n",
    "Diagram of broadcast join\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to trigger a broadcast join:\n",
    "1. Use the broadcast hint: [`F.broadcast()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.functions.broadcast.html) in PySpark or [`sdf_broadcast()`](https://spark.rstudio.com/packages/sparklyr/latest/reference/sdf_broadcast.html) in sparklyr\n",
    "2. Spark will use a broadcast join by default if the size of the DataFrame to be broadcast is known and smaller 10MB; this value can be changed with the [`spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-performance-tuning.html) configuration setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Using a Broadcast Hint \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the same source DataFrames as the sort merge join example, `rescue` and `population`. To perform a broadcast join, we just add the broadcast join hint `F.broadcast()`/`sdf_broadcast()` around `population`."

    "The plan here confirms that no join is taking place; instead, the conditional statements are interpreted as an SQL style `CASE WHEN` statement. There are only narrow transformations, meaning that the data can stay within the partitions and no shuffle is needed and therefore should be more efficient than a join.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be confirmed by looking at the Spark UI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/when_ui.png\n",
    "---\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This plan is far simpler than the other two we saw.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it may be tempting to use this method be careful. It is trickier to code and harder to read than a conventional join and also will not work if the source data changes, so if a new value appeared in `origin_of_call` (e.g. the RSPCA or the army, which may want a different `origin_type`) we would have to change the actual code rather than adding new lines to a reference file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In production code, it is best practice to use unit tests. These are very important when making efficiency improvements, since it is important that any changes do not affect the functionality of the code. See the articles on [Unit Testing in Spark](../testing-debugging/unit-testing) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use each method\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen examples of three ways of joining data:\n",
    "- Sort Merge Join\n",
    "- Broadcast Join\n",
    "- Replacing joins with a narrow transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "When should each be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, it is most important that your code works. Optimising your code prematurely can lead to errors, so it is often best to not concern yourself with the detail initially and let Spark make the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your code is working, the main question to answer is *is the second DataFrame small enough to be broadcast effectively?* If so, then a broadcast join is the best option. If not, use a sort merge join.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another question to answer is *should I turn the automatic broadcasting on or off*? Automatic broadcasting is useful if you are unsure as Spark will decide for you. It is also good for future-proofing if your source data grows in size, since it will automatically change to a sort merge join once it goes over the threshold; often large datasets started out as a small ones! However, only DataFrames which Spark can calculate the size of will be automatically broadcast; if not, a sort merge join will be used, even if the second DataFrame is tiny. If you are using automatic broadcasting, check the Spark UI or use `explain()` to verify the type of join.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some users prefer to have complete control, by setting `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` to `-1` and using the broadcast hints (`F.broadcast()`/`sdf_broadcast`). Be careful not to broadcast a DataFrame which grows in size over time if you choose to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the value of `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`, which may be useful for those using either very small or very large Spark sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The narrow transformation method was shown mainly to demonstrate that you can replace a join with a narrow transformation in certain circumstances. In practice, as such DataFrames will be tiny they can be broadcast anyway so it is not recommended. Only use this if your source data will never change, and be careful to extensively test and comment your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis above assumes that the join keys in the DataFrames are roughly equally partitioned. If your DataFrame is skewed so that some partitions contain significantly more data than others, then the efficiency of the join could be affected. See the article on [partitions](../spark-concepts/partitions) for more detail. The solution here is to use a *salted join*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Salted Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "A sort merge join will move all the data with the same join keys to the same partition, which can lead to skew in the DataFrame and cause the join to process inefficiently, or not at all in some cases. This can be resolved with a *salted join*: splitting the join keys, so that the DataFrame is distributed into more equal partition sizes. See the article on [salted joins](../spark-concepts/salted-joins) for more information.\n",
