    "## Creating DataFrames Manually\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Spark DataFrames are created by reading in data from another source, often a parquet file or Hive table, or a CSV file. It is also possible to manually create DataFrames without reading in from another source.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common cases for manually creating DataFrames is for creating input data and expected output data while writing unit tests; see the [Unit Testing in Spark](../testing-debugging/unit-testing) article for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that Spark DataFrames are processed on the Spark cluster, regardless of if they were read in from another source or created manually.\n",

    "[`spark.range()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.SparkSession.range.html)/[`sdf_seq()`](https://spark.rstudio.com/packages/sparklyr/latest/reference/sdf_seq.html) are functions which create a simple DataFrame with one column, `id`, with the specified number of rows. This can be useful as a starting point for creating synthetic or test data, or for generating a DataFrame containing random numbers.\n",

    "- To create a DF starting from a value other than `0`, then specify a `start` and `end` values, e.g. `spark.range(1, 6)`.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can also create Spark DataFrames from pandas or base R DataFrames. Spark DFs are processed in the Spark cluster, which means you have more memory when using Spark, and so some operations may be easier than in the driver, e.g. a join between two pandas/R DataFrames which results in a larger DF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that there are key differences between pandas/R DFs and Spark DFs. Spark DFs are not ordered by default and also have no index, so converting to Spark and then back will not preserve the original row order. Some operations are also easier with pandas/R than they are with Spark. See the Choosing between pandas/R and Spark article for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PySpark, use [`spark.createDataFrame(pandas_df)`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.SparkSession.createDataFrame.html), where `pandas_df` is the pandas DataFrame. You can also specify the `schema` argument here, although generally you will not need to as pandas DFs already have data types assigned. Note that if your pandas version is earlier that `0.25.0` there may be a bug when creating the DataFrame due to the column ordering. It is recommended to update to a later version of pandas to solve this.\n",
