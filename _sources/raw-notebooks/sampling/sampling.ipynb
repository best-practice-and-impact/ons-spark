This is because every row is independently assigned a probability equal to `fraction` of being included in the sample, e.g. with `fraction=0.2` every row has a $20\\%$ probability of being in the sample. The number of rows returned in the sample therefore follows the binomial distribution.\n",

This requires an action and a wide transformation, and so will take longer to process than using `.sample()`."
