# Introduction

Our **vision** is to fill the gap between Spark text books, official documentation and online examples as the go-to guide for analysts, data scientists and data engineers using PySpark and sparklyr.

Our **mission** is to share knowledge and experience across government to harness the potential of big data for [statistics for the public good](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/statistics-for-the-public-good/).

Some of our core **values** are:
- Openness and transparency
- Diversity and collaboration
- Good coding practices
- Efficiency and value for money

This book is open to contributions from anyone across UK Government and beyond.

ONS staff should also look at our GitLab pages for organisation and platform-specific information.
